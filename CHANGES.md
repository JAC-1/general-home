# Home Manager Rewrite - Summary of Changes

## Overview

This is a complete rewrite of your Home Manager configuration optimized for:
- **Non-NixOS systems** (Fedora, Omarchy, etc.)
- **Fish shell as primary** (with Bash/Zsh fallback)
- **Script-friendly** config management  
- **Separate nvim config** that won't be overwritten

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fish Shell Support (Primary)

Fish is now the main shell with full configuration including your grok function converted to Fish syntax. Scripts can integrate via ~/.config/fish/config.local.fish or the conf.d and functions directories.

### 2. Multi-Shell Support

All three shells (Fish, Bash, Zsh) configured with shared aliases, same environment, and local config integration points.

### 3. Neovim Independence

Your separate nvim config repo is protected - Home Manager will NOT manage ~/.config/nvim so you can update it independently.

### 4. Better Package Management

Organized packages with categories, many commented out to uncomment as needed, plus modern CLI tools enabled.

### 5. Script Integration

Scripts can safely modify shell configs:
- Fish: ~/.config/fish/config.local.fish
- Bash: ~/.bashrc.local or ~/.bashrc.d/
- Zsh: ~/.zshrc.local or ~/.zshrc.d/

### 6. Improved Documentation

Comprehensive README, USAGE guide, and examples directory with integration scripts.

## Next Steps

1. Review home/user/packages.nix and uncomment what you need
2. Verify Firefox profile path in config.nix
3. Test with: nix flake check
4. Apply with: home-manager switch --flake .#justin -b backup
5. Commit changes to git
